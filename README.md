# Boilerplate Middleman

This is a boilerplate Middleman project.

## Bower

[Bower](http://bower.io) for managing front-end packages. Run `bower install`
to install packages.

## Modernizr

[Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/docs) for browser tests.  The
`./modernizr-config.json` contains a manifest of all the tests.  Run `rake
development:modernizr` to rebuild the file. The config stays in version
control, the built file doesn't have to. Yay.
